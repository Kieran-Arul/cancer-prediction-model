## Project Overview

- This program uses TensorFlow (Keras) to build an Artificial Neural Network, then demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting whether a tumour is benign or malignant.
- The dataset was taken from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/shabbrikhan0015/cancer-classification/data

- The model was trained on 30 features including but not limited to:
  - Mean radius
  - Mean texture
  - Mean perimeter
  - Mean area
  - Mean smoothness
